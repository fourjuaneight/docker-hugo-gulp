# Code of Conduct
Plain and simple: don't be an asshole. If you need some clarification, the following logic is a good reference point.

## Guidelines
Do your PR/Comments include language describing your superior to other contributors?
- Fuck off.

Are you upset because things didn't go your way and you feel the need to blame someone else?
- See the previous answer.

Do you find people that differ in any way from yourself to be lesser than?
- See the first answer.

When someone tells you to stop or go away, do you find that funny and choose to ignore the persons' wishes? (Harassment. That's what this is. In case it's unclear to you.)
- See the first answer.

Are you repeating (read spamming) an issue with the same comments?
- Your repeating comments are welcomed in the `/dev/null` directory.

If none of these apply to you and behaving in a respectful and professional manner is obvious to you, then your contributions and constructive criticism are welcomed.
