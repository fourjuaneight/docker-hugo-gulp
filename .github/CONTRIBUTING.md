# How to Contribute

Pull requests and contributions are warmly welcome. Please follow the existing code style and commit message conventions. Also, remember to keep the documentation updated.

## Code reviews

All submissions require review. GitHub pull requests are used for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more info.

## Filing GitHub issues

Dependencies are kept to a minimum. Submit a pull request for any additional npm packages that you believe could be useful to most Hugo sites. Please refrain from suggesting packages specific to only yourself. For that, I would suggest a fork to customize for your needs.

## Guidelines

Plain and simple: don't be an asshole. If you need some clarification, the following logic is a good reference point.

 Do your PR/Comments include language describing your superior to other contributors?
- Fuck off.

Are you upset because things didn't go your way and you feel the need to blame someone else?
- See the previous answer.

Do you find people that differ in any way from yourself to be lesser than?
- See the first answer.

When someone tells you to stop or go away, do you find that funny and choose to ignore the persons' wishes? (Harassment. That's what this is. In case it's unclear to you.)
- See the first answer.

Are you repeating (read spamming) an issue with the same comments?
- Your repeating comments are welcomed in the `/dev/null` directory.
