# How to Contribute
Pull requests and contributions are warmly welcome. Please follow the existing code style and commit message conventions. Also, remember to keep the documentation updated.

## Code reviews
All submissions require review. GitHub pull requests are used for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more info.

## Filing GitHub issues
Dependencies are kept to a minimum. Submit a pull request for any additional npm packages that you believe could be useful to most Hugo sites. Please refrain from suggesting packages specific to only yourself. For that, I would suggest a fork to customize for your needs.
